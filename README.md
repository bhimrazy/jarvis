# Jarvis Project

Jarvis is an AI-based project focused on integrating speech recognition, language generation, and task execution capabilities using open-source models. The project's primary goal is to implement thinking processes based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and execute tasks based on user commands.

## Overview

The project comprises three key components:

- **Speech Recognition and Generation:** Handles the conversion of speech to text for user input and text to speech for LLM output.
- **Task Execution:** Executes various tasks based on recognized commands.
- **Thinking using LLM:** Utilizes Large Language Models for reasoning and decision-making.


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
